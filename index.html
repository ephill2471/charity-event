      <h2 class="center"<h2>About Trash Free Seas</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://oceanconservancy.org/">Ocean Conservatory</a> focuses on a lot of things such as Trash Free Seas, Smart Ocean Planning, Sustainable Fisheries, Restoring the Gulf of Mexico, Ocean Climate, and Confronting Ocean Acidification. The topic I would like to focus on is Trash Free Seas. Trash in seas or oceans is a very big threat to wildlife as well as people. Wildlife mistakens the trash as food as well as the plastic in some trash contains pollutants that can significantly harm the wildlife. PLastic has been found in 59% of all sea birds, 100% of sea turtles, and 25% of fish. Every year about 8 million metric tons of plastic enters our oceans every year.</P>
      <p>If nothing is done there could be a pound of plastic for every 3 pounds of fish caught. This plastic found in fish also has a way of entering our bodies as well. The fish that is caught to be sold could be sold to you with plastic in their systems, we then eat the fish and plastic is entered into our bodies. There is a way to change this, since 1985 Ocean Conservancy has collected 2228,919,809 pounds of trash and are still continuing to this day. Lets help make our oceans a beautiful place once again.</p>
